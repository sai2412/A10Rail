              Q. The maximum number of people can book on a single train ticket
              booking.
            </h3>
            <p>
              A. In one IRCTC ticket booking, there can be a maximum of only six
              passengers. You can easily add the names and ages of the ones
              along with whom you are travelling. By hitting on the edit button
              next to the names, choose each passenger's berth preference. You
              can also add the other passenger's meal choices on the app. Along
              with that you also have a few options when it comes to train
              reservations of six people in a single ticket. You can choose to
              book when all the berths are in the same coach or if only one or
              two lower berths are provided.

              it is easy to do it on the app and our website. All you have to do
              is visit your profile. Go to the My Trips section to see your

            <h3>Q. Are children charged for train tickets booking?</h3>
            <p>
              A. Children under five years of age are not charged for train
              reservation. However, the full fare is charged for those between
              five to 12 years of age. The charge is only applicable if, at the
              time of reservation, a berth is sought for the child separately.
              Then again, if there is no seat or berth sought for the child who
              is between the abovementioned age group, only half of the adult
              fare will be charged. Rajdhani and Shatabdi Express trains are the
              only ones that offer free meals as well to children below five
              years.
